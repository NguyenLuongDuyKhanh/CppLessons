## Decision making
### if - else
    Curly bracket can be skipped, in that case, 'if' statement recognize the first immediately below statement to be inside its block.

### switch - case

### Conditional Operation

### goto and labels
This is not recommended 
A label's scope is with in the function it is defined. 
Advantage: Use goto to exit from a nested loop, where as break cannot do 

## Repeation
### for loop

### range-based loop

### for each loop 
Defined in #include<algorithm>
Can be used effectively with a lambda/object type function
Much faster than a raw loop 
An array pointer do not know its size, for_each loops will not work with arrays without knowing the size of an array

### while

### do ... while loop

### break and continue
