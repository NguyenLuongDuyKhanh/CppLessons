#include <cstdio>
#include <stdio.h>

stdio.h: This is the C-style standard input/output library header file. It provides functions for input and output, such as printf, scanf, fgets, and more. It is designed for use in C programs but can also be used in C++ code if included.

cstdio: This is the C++-style standard input/output header. It's essentially the C++ version of stdio.h, but it places all of the functions from stdio.h into the std namespace to fit better with C++'s conventions and avoid polluting the global namespace.

3. Best Practice in C++
In modern C++ programming, it is considered better practice to use cstdio because it adheres to the C++ standard and helps avoid potential naming conflicts in the global namespace.

However, if you're maintaining older code or working in a mixed C/C++ environment, you might still encounter or use stdio.h.
