## Reference &

## Dereference *
To access the value at the address

## Pointer type *

    null is a macro in C and pre-C++11
    C++11 introduced nullptr
    Reading from a nullptr may causes access violation

## Reference vs Pointer

Bound to it referent   Can point to other variables
No storage required
