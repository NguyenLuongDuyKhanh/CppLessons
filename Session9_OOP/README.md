## The use of virtual
- A point of base class can point to any child class
- A function which take a point of base class type will perform method of base class, regardless the object it points to is a child class
- vitual keywork make the compiler to decide which method should be call in runtime

## TODO
To answer if an object is pass to a function, is its reference passed or a copy of it? investigate to shadow/deep copy in c++
