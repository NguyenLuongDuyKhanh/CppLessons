## 
Template function variants are generated by compiler at build time -> no cost at runtime
Templates do not follow definition and declaration convention -> can be defined in header file

## Two phases
Template Argument deduction -> The process of deducting types
Template Instansiation - The process of generating function variants


Explicit instantiation
Explicit specialization
