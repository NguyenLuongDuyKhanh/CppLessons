## Constructor
Default Constructor
    - Does not accept argument
    - Automatically generated by the compiler if no other user-defined exist

Parameterized Constructor
    - Accept one or more arguments
    - Never synthesized by the compiler
    - If a parameterized exit, it blocks auto generation of default constructor

Copy Constructor
    - Copy object's state in another object
    - Synthesized automatically, but user-defined implementation required for pointer members

Delegating Constructor
    - To avoid duplicated code in through constructors

Inheriting

## Destructor
- Compiler synthesizes if no other user-defined
- Automatically involked when an object is destroyed
- Used for releasing resources
- Cannot be overloaded
- No arguments

## Non-static data member initializers
- Member can be initialized in class's declaration rather than constructor
- To ensure the member are initialized with valid value
- Compiler will insert initialization code to constructor
- If a member is assign a value during construction, this new value will overwrite to what was specified in initialization

## default and delete
default
- Use to mark a function to be generated as default
- Use in constructor/destructor only
delete
- Use to prevent defining a function
- Use in all kind of functions
